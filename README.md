*CircleUp Software Engineering Internship*

I used JavaScript to do all my analyses.

*Fruit Salad:*

I used the request npm package to obtain the json1 file:

    npm install --save request

The data transformation can be found in 'fruitSalad.'
Each new value that was calculated is separated by comments, such as most_common_word_in_posts and balance.
The analyses section is also separated for each calculated value by comments.
I made a few assumptions when analyzing the data:
- In calculating the median age data, the true median would have been a decimal because there are 50 'users' in total
- A non-decimal number is required to complete analyses on further sections (favorite_fruit.median_age), so exactly half the length was taken to calculate the median
- I interpreted all the 'most common's as one most common, rather than several 'most common's

*Product Sales:*
I provided a query in the productSales.sql that would generate the correct metrics.
